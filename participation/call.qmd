### Call for submissions

The Political Communication Division of the International Communication Association (ICA) calls for applications for its co-organized 9th edition of the International Summer School in Political Communication that will be held 8-13 July 2026 at the University of Leeds. 

The ICA Political Communication Summer School addresses theoretical and empirical questions at the intersection of political communication, with a special focus on the relationship between political communication, media coverage, and political participation and democracy. This year’s theme is: “Political Communication and Conflict.” Lecturers will address key concepts and phenomena vis-à-vis a host of contemporary contexts, including elections and war. They will speak to the construction and processing of mediated (conflict-based) content and their implications for citizens and society at large.

Building on the experience of the last 15 years, the 2026 Summer School offers a unique opportunity for 30 PhD candidates and early-career academics in communication, sociology, psychology and political science:

- to attend an intensive, six-day program that consists of lectures, master classes, paper presentations and mentoring sessions, and
- to build long-lasting personal and scholarly relations in a celebrated friendly and productive environment.

Participation will be on a competitive basis. Candidates interested in applying to the Milan Summer School should submit a three-page research proposal or an extended abstract of a research paper on issues broadly related to political communication. Submissions should include the name, email address, institutional affiliation, a brief bio (max. 200 words) mentioning main research interests and ongoing projects, and a recommendation letter. An international selection committee will review the applications.
