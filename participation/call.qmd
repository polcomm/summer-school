### Call for submissions

The Political Communication Division of the International Communication Association (ICA) calls for applications for its co-organized 9th edition of the International Summer School in Political Communication that will be held 13-17 July 2026 at the Devonshire Hall, University of Leeds (UK).

The ICA Political Communication Summer School addresses theoretical and empirical questions at the intersection of political communication, political science, and political sociology, with a special focus on the impact of communication factors, from television to the new digital media, on electoral participation, political attitudes, and voting behavior. This year’s theme is: “Political Communication and Democratic Ideals”. 

Building on the experience of the last 17 years, the 2026 Summer School offers a unique opportunity for 30 PhD candidates and early-career academics in communication, sociology, psychology and political science:

- to attend an intensive, six-day program that consists of lectures, master classes, paper presentations and mentoring sessions, and
- to build long-lasting personal and scholarly relations in a celebrated friendly and productive environment.

Participation will be on a competitive basis. Candidates interested in applying to the ICA Summer School should submit a three-page research proposal or an extended abstract of a research paper on issues broadly related to political communication. Submissions should include the name, email address, institutional affiliation, a brief bio (max. 200 words) mentioning main research interests and ongoing projects, and a recommendation letter. An international selection committee will review the applications.

### Key Dates and Fees

- Application deadline: 1st March
 
Enrollment fee: £550 (covers accommodation).
